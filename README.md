# Msse663ProjectTylerWilliams

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.11.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
1. Run `npm install` from the root of the cloned directory. 
1. Get the `MONGO_PASSWORD` from Tyler. Feel free to email me at twilliams019@regis.edu if you don't have that handy and want to give it a shot. You'll have to put it in a file at the root of the project called `.env`. 

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. This will start both the Express app and the Angular frontend. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The Angular app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files for Angular.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

First, make sure the backend is running with `npm run backend`

Then, run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
